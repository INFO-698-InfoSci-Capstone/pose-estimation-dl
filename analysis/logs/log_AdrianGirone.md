Log entry on March 21, 2025

### Number of hours:
10 hours towards research + familiarizing ourselves with the toolset and tech stake, business analysis + requirements gathering meetings with stakeholders, proof of concept for a
solution

### Rose:
Highlight for me was meeting people, learning the proiblems faced by the people we are trying to assist with pose estimation
(Anna, who is doing social insects with bees and ants, and Martha, who is doing neuro diseases with flies and mice)
Our project is starting materialize and become clear; We are enabling their work with a state of the art toolset, utilization containerization, cloud computing, 
reproducible environments, and simple but effecive onboarding docs.

### Bud:
It seems like these initial requirements are very high value and low ish effort; So we should be able to make a large impact for them in a short amount of time,
pending a successful proof of concept and MVP.

### Thorn:
Even though we got a lot of information, really pinpointing what it is we want to accomplish, something that is realistic, reproducible, expandable, and high value given
our timeline, expertise, etc, has been ahrd. I think we are close, but not quite there, which is frustrating given how far into the semester we are. 

### Additional thought
Still need to finalize project proposal and then flesh out a timeline now that requirements are materializing -> "This is what we are doing, so how are we going to do it, and when do we need to do it by?"

Overall I think this week was productive and we are moving in a good direction, but we need to accelerate in order to hit both our teams learning goals and the stakeholders' needs
