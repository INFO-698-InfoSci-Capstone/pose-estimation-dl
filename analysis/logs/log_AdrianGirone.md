### Number of hours:
10 hours towards research + familiarizing ourselves with the toolset and tech stake, business analysis + requirements gathering meetings with stakeholders, proof of concept for a
solution

### Rose:
Highlight for me was meeting people, learning the proiblems faced by the people we are trying to assist with pose estimation
(Anna, who is doing social insects with bees and ants, and Martha, who is doing neuro diseases with flies and mice)
Our project is starting materialize and become clear; We are enabling their work with a state of the art toolset, utilization containerization, cloud computing, 
reproducible environments, and simple but effecive onboarding docs.

### Bud:
It seems like these initial requirements are very high value and low ish effort; So we should be able to make a large impact for them in a short amount of time,
pending a successful proof of concept and MVP.

### Thorn:
Even though we got a lot of information, really pinpointing what it is we want to accomplish, something that is realistic, reproducible, expandable, and high value given
our timeline, expertise, etc, has been ahrd. I think we are close, but not quite there, which is frustrating given how far into the semester we are. 

### Additional thought
Still need to finalize project proposal and then flesh out a timeline now that requirements are materializing -> "This is what we are doing, so how are we going to do it, and when do we need to do it by?"

Overall I think this week was productive and we are moving in a good direction, but we need to accelerate in order to hit both our teams learning goals and the stakeholders' needs

### Number of hours:
15 hours towards research + familiarizing ourselves with the toolset and tech stake, business analysis + requirements gathering meetings with stakeholders, proof of concept for a solution

### Rose:
Wrapping up our project proposal, have a clear direction for what we need to be doing, timelines, deliverables, lines of communication with stakeholders. It is daunting yet valuable and achievable

### Bud:
The containers are coming along nicely; For myself, I was working on the sleep one. We got the image to build and the container to run. This is good progress and will be foundational for then getting these tools and workflows into scalable cloud environments for the stakeholders

### Thorn:
There were a lot of issues with the container, including the base image and how that affects our ability to use the GUI portion of the app we are containerizing. We are working through that but due to the compleixty of the apps, the dockerizing process is taking longer than I would like

### Additional thoughts
Overall I think the team dynamic is developing nicely, people are settling into roles and tasks, and we have a good direction charted towards our final deliverable. I think going forward we will need to be more concerned with pace than direction or how we distribute work.

### Number of hours:
25 hours towards research and troubleshooting our SLEAP and Diplomat dockerfiles + builds

### Rose:
Finished proposal, met with a lot of stakeholders, made some working images with just SLEAP or just DLC. Also pushed some of those working containers to registries so others can pull them.

### Bud:
Made some good progress settings up SLEAP with Diplomat and GPU enhancement. 

### Thorn:
Issues with dependencies, environment setups, python version. Diplomat uses a higher version of python than what is offered by installing SLEAP with Conda or Mamba. So we are struggling with having one or multiple environments, one or multiple package managers, and making sure all dependencies and versions thereof behave nicely together

### Additional thoughts
I think that we can provide immense value to stakeholders with that we have, but the value is exponential if we can get all components of our proposal working nicely together. It is proving harder than anticpated, so there will be definitely be a dash near the end of the project to get everything together for a demo and onboarding for our stakeholders to use the tools we have brought together for them.
