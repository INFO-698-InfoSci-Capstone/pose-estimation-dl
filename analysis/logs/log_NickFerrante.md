# Weekly/Bi-Weekly Log

## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Date: 
Week of March 17, 2025

Date: March 22, 2025


### Number of hours: 
10 hours towards reviewing and researching platforms and tools (Docker, Ubuntu, GitHub resources), meeting with stakeholders narrowing the specifics of what the researchers are looking for from us, and starting to shape the content that will make up our proposal.

### Rose:
The highlight of this past week was being able to be directly involved in the meetings with the stakeholders and hearing what exactly they would like from us. Up to this point we had been receiving summaries of what the researchers were looking for, so it was nice to be able to hear directly from the researchers and get a clearer vision of the issues they face, and also allow us to get a better idea of how our proposal will start to take form.

In the previous weeks leading up to now, the biggest highlight was being able to successfully use the Ubuntu Desktop on CyVerse to install both DeepLabCut and SLEAP, and also document the installation process to allow consistent installation in the future. 

### Bud: 
I am looking forward to containerizing SLEAP and DeepLabCut for a couple reasons. The first reason is that this will be my first time working with Docker and I am looking forward to getting hands on experience after reviewing multiple resources, and the second reason is because one of the researchers we met with with this week, Anna Dornhaus, expressed excitement that we were able to efficiently install the tools as this has been a significant struggle for her students. She seemed very excited about us being able to create a container to remove the troubles with installation and setup, so I am looking forward to being able to do this for her.

### Thorn: 
A challenge I faced was that although I was able to install SLEAP and DeepLabCut with Ubuntu, I was unable to do so on my local device. I ran into troubles as a result of having multiple environments and conflicting dependencies and have been unable to resolve this issue thus far. 

## Additional thought
I would like to be able to install SLEAP and DeepLabCut on my local device, however Carlos and Nirav have wanted us to use Ubuntu so I will continue to move forward with that.

### Date: 
Week of March 24, 2025

Date: March 31, 2025


### Number of hours:
15 hours towards creating and modifying the Gantt chart for our project timeline, revising our project proposal based on feedback from our mentor, and the majority of the time being spent on the containerization of the Diplomat and DeepLabCut pose estimation tools. 


### Rose:
The highlight of this week was being able to successfully get a container running for an environment that supplies the use of Diplomat with DeepLabCut as the front-end. I think our proposal is also looking good, and I am happy we were able to get feedback from our mentors to make the necessary revisions that they would like to see.

### Bud:
After completing the Diplomat-DeepLabCut container and getting it into a state that is ready for user acceptance testing, I am looking forward to working on the Diplomat-SLEAP container. Although there is still some work left to be done on the Diplomat-DeepLabCut container, it has been nice to see the progress that has been made especially considering that the dockerization of these tools was rather daunting when work first began.

### Thorn: 
A challenge that I am working through is getting Diplomat's GUI to function properly. When running Diplomat on my local machine, I was able to display and use the GUI successfully upon the appropriate prompt in the terminal, however when running Diplomat in the container the GUI does not appear as it should when prompted in the container's terminal. I am working on creating a Kasm Desktop environment and hoping that when using the desktop's terminal the GUI will appear and function successfully.

## Additional thought
I am hoping the dockerization of these tools is not still giving us significant issues beyond the week of the 31st, I would like to begin user acceptance testing with the stakeholders' videos by the end of the week to feel good about our timeline, but I do feel as though we have the proper guidance and assistance from our mentors to keep us in good shape.

### Date: 
Week of April 7, 2025

Date: April 14, 2025


### Number of hours:
25 hours towards getting a better working understanding of DeepLabCut by attempting to perform and analysis with it, along with continued work on containerizing DeepLabCut and Diplomat.

### Rose:
The highlight of this week was getting to work with the software itself, up to this point I had been focusing entirely on the containerization of it so I didnâ€™t have a strong understanding of when the stakeholders would talk about the technical use details.

### Bud:
We now have working containers for both DeepLabCut and SLEAP, we just need to confirm they work correctly on Jetstream and CyVerse.

### Thorn: 
We are still facing significant issues installing Diplomat in the containers, which has resulted at us likely shifting away from Diplomat installation and leaving that for a future group.
