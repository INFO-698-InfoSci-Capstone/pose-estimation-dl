# Weekly/Bi-Weekly Log

## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Date: 
Week of March 17, 2025
Date: March 22, 2025


### Number of hours: 
10 hours towards reviewing and researching platforms and tools (Docker, Ubuntu, GitHub resources), meeting with stakeholders narrowing the specifics of what the researchers are looking for from us, and starting to shape the content that will make up our proposal.

### Rose:
The highlight of this past week was being able to be directly involved in the meetings with the stakeholders and hearing what exactly they would like from us. Up to this point we had been receiving summaries of what the researchers were looking for, so it was nice to be able to hear directly from the researchers and get a clearer vision of the issues they face, and also allow us to get a better idea of how our proposal will start to take form.

In the previous weeks leading up to now, the biggest highlight was being able to successfully use the Ubuntu Desktop on CyVerse to install both DeepLabCut and SLEAP, and also document the installation process to allow consistent installation in the future. 

### Bud: 
I am looking forward to containerizing SLEAP and DeepLabCut for a couple reasons. The first reason is that this will be my first time working with Docker and I am looking forward to getting hands on experience after reviewing multiple resources, and the second reason is because one of the researchers we met with with this week, Anna Dornhaus, expressed excitement that we were able to efficiently install the tools as this has been a significant struggle for her students. She seemed very excited about us being able to create a container to remove the troubles with installation and setup, so I am looking forward to being able to do this for her.

### Thorn: 
A challenge I faced was that although I was able to install SLEAP and DeepLabCut with Ubuntu, I was unable to do so on my local device. I ran into troubles as a result of having multiple environments and conflicting dependencies and have been unable to resolve this issue thus far. 

## Additional thought
I would like to be able to install SLEAP and DeepLabCut on my local device, however Carlos and Nirav have wanted us to use Ubuntu so I will continue to move forward with that.
